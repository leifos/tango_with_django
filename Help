2. Download and install the PIP module 

3. If you are in  Windows,you might probably get stuck at installation process, if not...go ahead and enjoy

4. If you get stuck at Python registry problem,you need to download PyReg script.

5. Copy paste that code in your favorite editor and run in your system,where you should end up getting "Python 2.x/3.x version is now registered"

6. Now you can install the PIP module successfull

7. Go to your "tango_with_django" folder and run  "./manage.py syncdb" 

8. The above process will create database and various tables defined in the database

9. Now you are one step closer to run the project....go ahead and run your server "./manage.py runserver "
